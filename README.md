# Delivery-Driver-Router
Creates optimized routes for a delivery driver using a graph.

When prompted, the user inputs the name of a file with a description of the graph, then inputs the name of a file with the various locations the drivers need to hit. The program then determins if a driver's path is posible, and if the path is possible, then the fastest route is calculated. The program then returns the total time for the most effecient path.

The files graph.txt, graph2.txt, drivers.txt, and drivers2.txt are sample input files that were used to test the code.
